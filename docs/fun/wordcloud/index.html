<p>I think word clouds are a pretty reasonable way to graphically summarize content. When properly implemented, they provide a list of important terms and an easy way to discern how significant those terms are in the source text. I didn't really have anything else to feature on my home page, so a word cloud seemed like an apt way to encompass the content of my personal site without duplicating information available on one of the other pages.</p>

<p>To create a word cloud, I needed a way to obtain the rendered text of every page that I have. Because some parts of this website are programmatically rendered to HTML by my SSG (e.g. the portfolio page, posts like these), I wrote a quick function to find all <code>.html</code> files created as outputs. From there, I isolated the "content" areas of each page with BeautifulSoup. To further refine this text, I used NLTK's list of "stop words" to remove terms that aren't particularly important for the purpose of creating a summary (e.g. this, that, and, etc).</p>

<p>Once I had a list of words, it was time to actually create the cloud. Thankfully, theres the <code>wordcloud</code> Python module which can turn a string of text into an SVG. I wrote a simple function to create a color gradient that I like (#d8d8d8 to <span class="blue">#7cafc2</span>) and passed that along to the image generator.</p>

<p>When I first tested the setup, it worked about as well as I had expected: an image showed up on the home page. However, it wasn't very great to look at: the cloud was too short on mobile yet big enough on desktop that a user would need to scroll to see the whole thing. To accommodate these different screen sizes, I decided to render the cloud at different aspect ratios, from 1:10 to 49:10. Then, I wrote some quick JS to load in the SVG which would fit best on the page.</p>

<p>Although there isn't really much of note to summarize (one of the most common words is "site" for example), this was a fun thing to add, and I think it looks pretty cool.</p>
