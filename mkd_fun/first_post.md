# Hello world!
This is my first post on the site. I created a simple addition to my SSG which converts Markdown into HTML that's properly formatted and styled. The SSG now also automatically populates my 'fun' page for every new post that I make, and it sorts from oldest to most recent modification date.
## Hope you enjoy!
